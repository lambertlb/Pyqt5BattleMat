<h2 id="Overview">Electronic Battle Mat Overview</h2>
<p>Electronic Battle mat is a Web Application to help DMs and
    players have a better experience for running a role playing game. It
    encompasses four modes of operation.
<ol>
    <li>Creating and editing Template dungeons</li>
    <p>Template dungeons contain all the maps and resources needed for
        managing a single adventure. It is called a template because it is
        not actually used directly by end users. This is because multiple
        groups could be playing the same dungeon at the same time and you
        would not want them to interfere with each other.</p>
    <li>Creating Dungeon Session</li>
    <p>A dungeon session is a copy of a dungeon template that is owned
        by a certain group. This session is private so it can be changed
        without interfering with other groups playing the same one.</p>
    <li>DMing a Session</li>
    <p>
        In this mode of operation a DM takes control of a session. They can
        do may things like clear areas of FOG of WAR so players can see
        stuff. They can make monsters and room objects visible or invisible
        to players. They can move pogs around the map to show correct
        positions. They can add new stuff like monsters that were not in the
        dungeon template <b>SURPRISE this dragon happened by and wants to
        eat your face</b>.
    </p>
    <li>Player joining a Session</li>
    <p>In this mode of operation a player can view the Battle Mat.
        They have very little functionality other than panning and zooming
        the map. They can also create a PC pog and move it around the visible
        areas of the map.</p>
</ol>

</ol>
<h3 id="BattleMat">Battle Mat Area</h3>
<p>
    This area is where the map and all the objects placed on it appear.
    When you are DMing a session this will also display the areas that
    have <b>Fog of War (FOW)</b> on them. It will be transparent to the DM
    but will be solid black to the players preventing them from seeing
    stuff. Following are a few things you can do with and to this area.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Pan the Map</li>
    <p>By clicking on the map and holding the mouse button down you
        can change the position of the map.</p>
    <li>Zoom the Map</li>
    <p>By spinning the center mouse button you can zoom in and out of
        the map.</p>
    <li>Move Pogs around</li>
    <p>You can click on a pog and drag it to a new spot.</p>
    <li>Add new pogs to map</li>
    <p>By dragging and dropping a picture of a pog from the ribbon bar
        you will create a new pog on the map. This is a copy of the pog and
        not the original. So if you want two more of a monster already on the
        map. You just need to select it so it shows in the ribbon bar then
        drag and drop twice from the ribbon bar.</p>
    <li>Change properties of a pog</li>
    <p>By right clicking on a pog you can change some properties. Like
        make it visible or invisible to players or give it a number to help
        players more easily identify it. You can even delete it from the map.</p>
    <li>Adjust Fog of War</li>
    <p id="ClearingFOW">Dms have the ability to adjust what the
        players see I.E. change the fog of war. This can be done several ways
        only when DMing a session</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Toggle FOW check box on ribbon bar</li>
        <p>The DM can enable this mode by clicking in the checkbox. Once
            in this mode you can click on the map in a grid square. The FOW in
            that square will toggle. If you hold down the mouse button and move
            around the map other squares will also change to what the starting
            one was.</p>
        <li>Shift click in a grid square</li>
        <p>The DM can change FOW by just holding SHIFT key down and
            clicking in a square. The FOW in that square will toggle. If you
            hold down the mouse button and move around the map other squares
            will also change to what the starting one was.</p>
        <li>Control click in a grid square</li>
        <p>The DM can change FOW by just holding Control key down and
            clicking in a square. Now you drag to form a red rectangle. All the
            squares in to rectangle will change to the opposite of the first one
            you clicked in.</p>
    </ol>
</ol>
<h3 id="InformationManagement">Information Management area</h3>
<p>This area allows the DM to edit and create all kinds of
    information related to the dungeon. It is broken into different tabs
    to help separate functionality.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Art Assets</li>
    <p>This area allows you to manage the artwork needed for you
        dungeon</p>
    <li>Dungeon Editor</li>
    <p>This area allows you to edit and add dungeon levels</p>
    <li>Pog Editor</li>

        pogs.</p>
</ol>


<h2 id="CreateNewDungeon">Creating a New Dungeon</h2>
<p>These are the steps to create a new dungeon. You have access to
    this dialog just after you log in.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check the <b>I am DM</b> check box
    </li>
    <p>This opens up all the operations and privileges of a Dungeon
        Master.</p>
    <li>Name the new dungeon</li>
    <p>
        In the text box labeled "<b>Enter Dungeon Name</b>&quot; enter the
        name of your new dungeon. You can use letters, numbers and spaces in
        the name. The name must be greater than 4 letters long and cannot
        match an existing name. Once a legal name is entered the &quot;<b>Create
        New Dungeon</b>&quot; button will be enabled.
    </p>
    <img src="help/ManageDungeons2.png">
    <li>Click the &quot;<b>Create New Dungeon</b>&quot; button
        <p>
            This will create a new dungeon with the entered name by copying the
            "Template" dungeon. It should now be visible in the &quot;<b>Select
            a Dungeon for Operations</b>&quot; list.
        </p> <img src="help/ManageDungeons7.png">
    </li>
</ol>


<h2 id="EditDungeon">Editing a Dungeon</h2>
<p>These are the steps to edit a dungeon.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check the <b>I am DM</b> check box
    </li>
    <p>This opens up all the operations and privileges of a Dungeon
        Master.</p>
    <li>Select a Dungeon to edit</li>
    <p>
        In the drop down called &quot;<b>Select a Dungeon for Operations</b>&quot;
        select a dungeon to edit. This will enable the &quot;<b>Edit
        Dungeon</b>&quot; button.
    </p>
    <li>Press the &quot;<b>Edit Dungeon</b>&quot; button
    </li>
    <p>This will load in the dungeon and display the first level map.
        The ribbon bar will also map to the available operations that the DM
        can do on the dungeon.</p>
</ol>


<h2 id="ManageArtAssets">Managing Art Assets</h2>
<p>One of the first operations you will probably need to do is
    manage some of the art assets. Specifically you will probably want to
    have access to a picture that will be used for this level of the
    dungeon</p>
<img src="help/ArtAssets1.png">
<p>Above you can see that there are already some assets available
    and they belong in three categories.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Dungeon Assets</li>
    <p>All items in this list belong specifically to the Dungeon you
        are currently editing. For example level1.png is the picture for
        level 1. So if you need to add or subtract any artwork for your
        dungeon it would be in this list. dungeonData.json is a JSON
        formatted text file containing all the information about the dungeon.
        You should not need to manipulate this file manually. You can edit it
        using the Dungeon Editor Tab</p>
    <li>Global Monster Assets</li>
    <p>This list contains any pictures for monsters that you wish to
        have available across all dungeons. pogs.json is a JSON formatted
        text file containing the pog information that uses the pictures. You
        should not need to manipulate this file manually. You can edit it
        using the Pog Editor Tab.</p>
    <li>Global Room Assets</li>
    <p>This list contains any pictures for room objects that you wish
        to have available across all dungeons. pogs.json is a JSON formatted
        text file containing the pog information that uses the pictures. You
        should not need to manipulate this file manually. You can edit it
        using the Pog Editor Tab.</p>
</ol>

<h2 id="AddingArtAssets">Adding Art Assets</h2>
<p>Following is how you would add an art asset.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select where you want the asset to be uploaded to.</li>
    <p>
        For example you may wish this to be a dungeon asset so select the <b>Dungeon
        Assets</b> area. You can select either the top level or any items in the
        list. This will enable the <b>Choose File</b> button.
    </p>
    <img src="help/ArtAssets2.png">
    <li>Choose file you wish to upload.</li>
    <p>
        Click the <b>Choose File</b> button then navigate to and select the
        picture file you wish to upload then press the open button. The
        filename should show up next to the Choose File button. The <b>Upload
        Asset</b> button should become enabled.
    </p>
    <li>Upload the file.</li>
    <p>
        Click the <b>Upload Asset</b> button to actually upload it to the
        server. The list should update and show you the new file.
    </p>
</ol>

<h2 id="DeletingArtAssets">Deleting Art Assets</h2>
<p>
    Select the item you wish to delete and the <b>Delete Asset</b> button
    will enable. Just click it to delete the asset. Some assets like
    dungeonData or pogs .json files cannot be deleted.
</p>

<h2 id="SelectingArtAssets">Selecting Art Assets</h2>
<p>When you need to use an art asset in either the Dungeon Editor
    or the Pog Editor just select a picture file in one of the lists. The
    file path for the file you selected will show up under the buttons at
    the top of the panel. This path is also save internally and is
    available to be used by the mentioned editor. See those editors on the
    specifics on how to get at it.</p>

<h2 id="ManageDungeonLevels">Managing Dungeon Levels</h2>
<p>
    The tab labeled <b>Dungeon Editor</b> allows you to edit levels of the
    dungeon. What information is shown here is dependent on what level is
    selected in the drop down list on the ribbon bar.
</p>
<img src="help/DungeonEditor1.png">
<p>Following is a brief description of what the items in this view
    do.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Manage Dungeons button</li>
    <p>
        This will call up the Manage Dungeons Dialog box allowing you to
        switch dungeons or create new ones as described in <a
            href="#CreateNewDungeon">Creating a New Dungeon.</a>
    </p>
    <li>New Level button</li>
    <p>This will clear out the information for the current level and
        make the entries ready for a new one. You just need to fill in the
        appropriate information and click the save button to create the new
        level.</p>
    <li>DELETE Level button</li>
    <p>
        This deletes the currently selected level. <b>There is no undo so
        be very careful with this.</b>
    </p>
    <li>Level Name</li>
    <p>This is where you enter or change the name of the selected
        level</p>
    <li>Show Grid checkbox</li>
    <p>This is where you enable or disable the grid from showing on
        the map. This is mainly used for sizing the grid. Most maps have the
        grid already drawn on them but this tool needs to match that grid in
        size and position so you would enable the grid to help with that</p>
    <li>Grid Size button</li>
    <p>To assist in figuring out the size of a grid square you can do
        the following. Go to the map and zoom in until one square is pretty
        large. Then control click in the upper left corner of the square and
        draw a rectangle to the lower right corner. Then release the mouse
        button. The size of this box will get captured internally and get put
        into the Dungeon editor dialog when you press the Grid Size button.
        This will get the number close but might need some manual tweaking.
        The number can have a decimal point in it so you can fine tune it.</p>
    <img src="help/DungeonEditor2.png">
    <li>OffsetX and OffsetY</li>
    <p>Once you have the grid size correct you probable will need to
        have the grid move up, down, left or right. You enter decimal numbers
        in Offset X and Y to do that.</p>
    <li>Use Selected picture resource button</li>
    <p>
        The text area next to this button is where you enter the URL for the
        picture you wish to use for this level. The picture can be gotten
        from the internet by using its web path. It can also be gotten from
        one of your assets you uploaded in the asset management tab. Just go
        there and select the picture then come back here and press the <b>Selected
        picture resource</b> button.
    </p>
    <li>Save button</li>
    <p>If all information in the dialog area is correct then the save
        button will enable. Just press it to save the data. If you had pushed
        the New Level button then a new level will be created with the
        information else the existing level will be edited.</p>
    <li>Cancel button</li>
    <p>Pressing cancel will throw away changes and revert back to
        original information.</p>
</ul>

<h2 id="ManagePogs">Managing Pogs</h2>
<p>
    The tab labeled <b>Pog Editor</b> allows you to edit, create and
    delete pogs. Pogs are the little pictures you can create and drop onto
    the map. They represent the monsters, Player characters, and room
    object that might exist in the dungeon.
</p>
<img src="help/PogEditor1.png">
<ul>
    <li>Create Pog Button</li>
    <p>This will clear out the dialog information in preparation for
        creating a new Pog.</p>
    <li>DELETE Pog Button</li>
    <p>
        This delete the currently selected pog. <b>There is no undo so be
        very careful with this.</b>
    </p>
    <li>Pog Name</li>
    <p>
        This is where you give your pog a name. I suggest you use the
        following guideline in doing that. Make the name by using RACE CLASS
        SEX separated by spaces. By doing this in the future filtering can
        easily be added to narrow down choices to help find things.</b>
    </p>
    <li>Pog type</li>
    <p>
        There are three choices. MONSTER, ROOM OBJECT, and PLAYER. The type
        are mostly to help separate them in lists. Players are the only
        unique ones because there can only ever be one instance. So if you
        drag and drop them on a different map they disappear from the
        original map. Also PLAYER can only be created and used when DMing a
        session because they exist in the Session data and not in the dungeon
        data as explained later.</b>
    </p>
    <li>Pog Location</li>
    <p>This is where the data for this pog resides. Following are the
        possibilities.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dungeon Level</li>
        <p>This means the data exists in the dungeonData.json file in the
            section for a specific level. Most of the time data is gotten here
            by dragging and dropping a pog from the ribbon bar onto the map. A
            copy of the select pogs information in placed in the Dungeon Level.
            This is where you would also create any dungeon specific pogs.</p>
        <li>Session Level</li>
        <p>This means the data for the pog is stored in the
            sessionData.json file in a specific session. This file starts out as
            a copy of dungeonData.json file. This way any pogs moved around,
            created or deleted only affect the one session. Data is only changed
            here when the DM is managing a session.</p>
        <li>Player Location</li>
        <p>This means the data for the pog is stored in the
            sessionData.json file in a specific session. The data for these
            player characters are in a special portion of the sessionData.json
            file. Data is only changed here when the DM is managing a session.</p>
        <li>Common Resource</li>
        <p>This means the data for the pog is stored in the pogs.json
            file in common resource area. This area is outside of any specific
            dungeon and therefore applies to all of them. This is where you
            would add pogs that all dungeons might shares like Kobolds.</p>
    </ul>
    <li>Use Selected picture resource button</li>
    <p>
        The text area next to this button is where you enter the URL for the
        picture you wish to use for this pog. The picture can be gotten from
        the internet by using its web path. It can also be gotten from one of
        your assets you uploaded in the asset management tab. Just go there
        and select the picture then come back here and press the <b>Selected
        picture resource</b> button.
    </p>
    <li>Edit Notes button</li>
    <p>Pressing this button will bring up a dialog box the will allow
        you edit either the player visible notes or the DM notes that the
        players don't see. Any pog can have notes on them. These are useful
        for adding box text to the map.</p>
    <li>Pog size drop down</li>
    <p>Next to the notes button is a size drop down. Normal means the
        pog takes up one grid square. Large is 2x2. Huge is 3x3. Gargantuan
        is 4x4</p>
    <li>Player Flags button</li>
    <p>This button will bring up a dialog to select player flags.
        These are flags players can adjust during a session.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dead</li>
        <p>This means the monster or player is dead. An indicator will be
            placed on the Pog to denote that.</p>
        <li>Invisible</li>
        <p>This means the monster or player is invisible. The pog will be
            transparent to denote that. This transparent pog can be seen by
            players.</p>
    </ul>
    <li>DM Flags button</li>
    <p>This button will bring up a dialog to select DM flags. These
        are flags only a DM can manipulate.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Invisible to Player</li>
        <p>This means the monster or PC is invisible to players. The pog
            will be transparent to the DM denote that. This transparent pog
            cannot be seen by players.</p>
        <li>Transparent Background</li>
        <p>If the picture for a pog has a transparent background then it
            is allowed to be used. Otherwise a white background is used.</p>
        <li>Shift to Right</li>
        <p>Normally pogs are draw with the upper left corner matching the
            upper left corner of a grid square. Something you might wish it to
            be over a bit for example a secret door would be on the wall and not
            in a square. By selecting this option the pog will move to the right
            half a square.</p>
        <li>Shift to Top</li>
        <p>Normally pogs are draw with the upper left corner matching the
            upper left corner of a grid square. Something you might wish it to
            be over a bit for example a secret door would be on the wall and not
            in a square. By selecting this option the pog will move up half a
            square.</p>
        <li>Dark background in edit mode</li>
        <p>Sometimes a light pog picture is hard to see against a light
            background. By making the background dark in edit mode it helps.</p>

<h2 id="CreatingaSession">Creating a Session</h2>
<p>To create a new session do the following steps.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Get into the Manage Dungeons dialog.</li>
    <p>You can do this by revisiting the Electronic Battle Mat screen
        and log back in.</p>
    <li>Check the <b>I am DM</b> check box
    <li>Select the template dungeon you wish to make a session for</li>
    <img src="help/ManageDungeons.png">
    <li>Enter a new Session name</li>
    <p>This name must be unique from other sessions in this dungeon
        and it must be at least 4 characters long and can't start with "Enter
        "</p>
    <img src="help/ManageDungeons3.png">
    <li>Click the &quot;<b>Create New Session</b>&quot; to create the
        session.
    </li>
    <p>Now the Session name should be in the Select session list. This
        makes it available for functions like "DM the Session" or "Delete the
        Session"</p>
    <p>
        <b>NOTICE: Once you create a session any edits you make on the
            template dungeon will not show up in the session. This is because a
            session is actually a copy of the dungeons database so any new
            changes will not show up in the copy.</b>
    </p>
</ol>
<h2 id="DMingaSession">DMing a Session</h2>
<p>Following are things you need to know and do while DMing a
    session.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Add PCs (Player Characters) artwork</li>
    <p>
        One of the first thing you will want to do is create some Player
        Characters. To do this you first upload all the pictures you need to
        use if you don't have a URL for them. You do this in the Assets Tab
        under the Dungeon Assests tree. <a href="#AddingArtAssets">Adding
        Art Assets</a>
    </p>
    <li>Create a pog for PC</li>
    <p>
        You will then need to create a pog for each PC in the Pog Editor. <a
            href="#ManagePogs">Managing Pogs</a> Make sure to select pog type
        "PLAYER" and pog location as "Player Location".
    </p>
    <li>Clear FOG of WAR in an area</li>
    <p>
        Clear FOG of WAR in an area on the starting map where you wish the
        PCs to start. <a href="ClearingFOW">Clearing FOW</a> I usually do
        this by Control clicking and drawing a selection rectangle. All grid
        squares in the rectangle will toggle.
    </p>
    <li>Place PCs on map</li>
    <p>To place PCs on the map go to the Pog Editor tab and expand the
        Players tree. Then one at a time select a name in the list. This will
        selected the pog and the picture should show up in the ribbon bar and
        also at the bottom of the pog editor. You can now click on either
        picture and drag it onto the map. You will need to do this step every
        time the players go to a new level.</p>
    <li>DM the session</li>
    <p>DMing is fairly straight forward. You just clear FOW from areas
        you want players to see. You can move around pogs during combat. You
        can change properties of a pog by right clicking on it for doing
        things like marking it as dead. You can add more monsters on the fly
        be selecting one either on the map or in the Pog editor and dragging
        and dropping it to the map from the ribbon bar.</p>
</ol>
