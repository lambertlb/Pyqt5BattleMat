# Pyqt5BattleMat

Make an electronic battle mat using python and PySide2

I did this as a learning experiment to learn Python and QT

This is basically a conversion of the ElectronicBattleMat project done in GWT

It includes two parts
BattleMatServer.py will start a web service in your local network
BattleMat.py will start the client.
You can also use a browser as a client.

## Defendants

pip install PySide2
pip install event-bus
